# PerformanceTestCustomUpdateCalls
This is an extended version of my friend AlMartson project about unity update calls performance fix.
Main idea is avoiding Unityâ€™s own update method if you are running many Monobehaviours at the same time by implimenting a update manager.

The original projects manager is using an array of modified Monobehaviours that it cycles through with an for loop each update. The manager calls a update method on each element.

Initially I wanted to try different approaches about the update manager for example using listeners.
But also decided to update it with diffrent tests.

Current tests:
- Unity Update
- Update manager with an Array
- Update manager with a delegate
- Update manager with a List and foreach loop
- Update manager with a List and for loop

Each manager updates a set amount of objects, all these updates do is increment an number, for 10 seconds.


## Results and thoughts when testing with 10 000 and 50 000 updated gameobjects:
As expected the Unity update was slowest in execution but didnt take long to initialize.
Slightly slower initiation, only a few ms, the Array was about 67% faster than the prior test case.

Roughly the same execution rate at 10 000 objects but alot slower initiation time for the delegate, 66ms vs 208ms, with 10 000 objects. With 50 000 objects the difference goes from 215% 730% and also start losing some FPS.

The List managers has same initiation time as the Array and the for loop managed one had only 10 less fps at 10 000 objects but 100 less at 50 000 objects.

My own conclusion is that the manager with an array wins all the perfromance tests but its gonna be a pain to manage an array if there are alot of gameobejects that are added / removed. 
In that scenario I would prefer a List most of the time, the Observer would also work if you are not trying to initiate alot of objects at the same time.

## How to use?
1. Download project
2. Open in Unity
3. Run it

Do you have your own test to that u want to creat?
1. Drag in the PresetUpdateTest
2. Create a new gameobjec and add a c# script to be tested, make it inherit TestCase.
3. Add it to the Factorys "Object to Instanciate.
4. Add "SpawnedObjectContainer" to target transfrom in the factory.

Optional
1. If you want the initialize time to be measured correctly use TestCase's Setup function to set the gameobject up.
2. If the Manager needs some time to set up, create a "BoolValue" scriptable object from "create asset" menu and hook it up to the factory and your manager.

## Original ReadMe


This is my custom version of [https://github.com/valyard/Unity-Updates, original Blog: https://blogs.unity3d.com/es/2015/12/23/1k-update-calls/ ], ready to be modified to make an optimum new video game.


## How does it work?

If you are developing a Unity video game that has MANY GameObjects, each one with its own 'Update()' Method (in its own Script); then you may encounter a performance problem. With this example (or rather: 'Empty Project Skelleton'), you can Optimize your game by using ONLY ONE Unity-Update Method. In the Unity Blog it was called: the 'manager pattern'. Just replace the 'Original Game Object'. The same Idea can be applied with LateUpdate() and FixedUpdate() methods.

NOTE: If your game has a GameManager (with an Update method), and you only have a few Scripts with the Update() method (for instance: less than 20 GameObjects updating themselves at the same time...), maybe this pattern is not the ideal solution. It is a good optimization only when you have several Scripts running their own Update()'s separately. 

I recommend you to read the original (great eye-opener) Unity Blog article: https://blogs.unity3d.com/es/2015/12/23/1k-update-calls/ .

It has been tested in Unity 2018.4.0f1. You have a Timer-Counter GameObject to Benchmark it if you feel so.

I hope this helps someone.
Happy video game coding!
