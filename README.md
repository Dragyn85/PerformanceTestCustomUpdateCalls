# PerformanceTestCustomUpdateCalls
This is an extended version of my friends project about unity update calls performance testing.
Main idea is avoiding Unityâ€™s own update method if you are running many Monobehaviours at the same time.

The original projects manager is using an array of modified Monobehaviours that it cycles through with an for loop each update. The manager calls a update method on each element.

Initially I wanted to try different approaches about the update manager for example using listeners.
But also decided to update and make it easier for others to see and try for themself, maybe you have different results.


## Original ReadMe


This is my custom version of [https://github.com/valyard/Unity-Updates, original Blog: https://blogs.unity3d.com/es/2015/12/23/1k-update-calls/ ], ready to be modified to make an optimum new video game.


## How does it work?

If you are developing a Unity video game that has MANY GameObjects, each one with its own 'Update()' Method (in its own Script); then you may encounter a performance problem. With this example (or rather: 'Empty Project Skelleton'), you can Optimize your game by using ONLY ONE Unity-Update Method. In the Unity Blog it was called: the 'manager pattern'. Just replace the 'Original Game Object'. The same Idea can be applied with LateUpdate() and FixedUpdate() methods.

NOTE: If your game has a GameManager (with an Update method), and you only have a few Scripts with the Update() method (for instance: less than 20 GameObjects updating themselves at the same time...), maybe this pattern is not the ideal solution. It is a good optimization only when you have several Scripts running their own Update()'s separately. 

I recommend you to read the original (great eye-opener) Unity Blog article: https://blogs.unity3d.com/es/2015/12/23/1k-update-calls/ .

It has been tested in Unity 2018.4.0f1. You have a Timer-Counter GameObject to Benchmark it if you feel so.

I hope this helps someone.
Happy video game coding!
